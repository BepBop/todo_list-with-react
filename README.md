# todo_list-with-react

## As to practice maintainability, forced myself to refactor it after a month
Refactoring was targeted at both React and CSS 

## Style-1
As a learning opportunity I constrained myself to using 1 hook i.e. useState... It was a fun learning experience!

## Style-2
Un-restraining myself and using, use effect hook with use state made the code lot simpler.
